# Introduction

OER publishing programs are expensive to operate and sustain. As librarians who provide OER publishing services to our campus, we developed workflows to help minimize the digital production, hosting, and maintenance costs of OER publishing by using open source software, free web services, and [static web technologies](https://lib-static.github.io). 

Lantern is an OER publishing toolkit that guides users through our workflows to create simple, accessible, multi-format OER using minimal computing methods. No coding experience or expensive software is required. With Lantern, beginners can go from manuscript to published OER in about an hour.

"[Minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)" is a critical framework that applies minimalist principles to computing. It promotes placing constraints on hardware, software, network power, and infrastructure in order to enable access and participation regardless of resources. Minimal computing prioritizes sustainability, simplifies system maintenance, and mitigates technological obsolesence.

## Features

- **Free:** Lantern uses open source software and free-of-charge web services for processing, building, deploying, and hosting OER. 

- **Portable:** Lantern emphasizes the use of plain text file formats that can run on any machine or web host. No databases or servers are required. 

- **Multi-format:** Lantern teaches semantic markup technologies for producing Markdown, HTML, PDF, docx, EPUB, and LaTeX editions of OER. 

- **Sustainable:** Lantern minimizes the infrastructure, configuration, hosting, and maintenance costs related to traditional digital publishing systems and platforms.

- **Accessible:** Lantern priortizes accessibility and provides users with accessible templates and guidance on creating content that meets accessibility standards.

- **Multimedia friendly**: Lantern works with embed code and MathJax so authors can use audio, video, H5P modules, and math equations on the HTML editions of their OER. 


## Who is Lantern for?

We created Lantern for the open education community: librarians, faculty authors, and self-publishers.

**What does Lantern mean?**

Lantern is the nickname for the atrium entrance to the main Library at Northwestern, which resembles a giant lantern. It's a rounded tower of windows that opens to the most heavily used study area in the building. In our case, the name represents a starting point for a new way of open textbook production.

Lantern is a project by Chris Diaz (Digital Publishing Librarian) and Lauren McKeen McDonald (Open Education Librarian) of Northwestern University with support from the [Association of Research Libraries](https://www.arl.org/). Lantern is based on [Pandoc Book Template](https://github.com/wikiti/pandoc-book-template), and was inspired by numerous publishing tools, including [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), [Quire](https://quire.netlify.app/), [Course-in-a-Box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/), [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), and [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/).
