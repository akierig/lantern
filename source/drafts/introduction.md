# Introduction

OER creation and adoption is on the rise

"[Minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)" is a critical framework that applies minimalist principles to computing. It promotes placing constraints on hardware, software, network power, and infrastructure in order to enable access and participation regardless of resources. Minimal computing prioritizes sustainability, simplifies system maintenance, and mitigates technological obsolesence. Lantern is a toolkit that applies this framework to the production of OER.

## Features

- **Free:** Lantern uses open source software and free-of-charge web services for processing, building, deploying, and hosting OER. 

- **Portable:** Lantern emphasizes the use of plain text file formats that can run on any machine or web host. No databases or servers are required. 

- **Multi-format:** Lantern teaches semantic markup technologies for producing Markdown, HTML, PDF, docx, and LaTeX editions of OER. 

- **Sustainable:** Lantern minimizes the infrastructure, configuration, hosting, and maintenance costs related to traditional digital publishing systems and platforms.

- **Accessible:** Lantern's templates comply with WCAG 2.1 standards and provides direction on accessible content creation to ensure your published OER will be accessible to all.


> Plain text files have many advantages over other formats. For one, they are readable on virtually all devices. They have also withstood the test of time better than other file types – if you’ve ever tried to open a document saved in a legacy word processor format, you’ll be familiar with the compatibility challenges involved.

**What does Lantern mean?**

Lantern is the nickname for the atrium entrance to the Main Library at Northwestern, which resembles a giant lantern. It's a rounded tower of windows that opens to the most heavily used study area in the building. In our case, the name represents a starting point for a new way of open textbook production.

## Who is Lantern for?

Lantern was developed as a minimal computing toolkit for the open education community. We are librarians who provide publishing services to faculty OER authors. We recognize that OER publishing programs are expensive to operate and sustain, so we developed Lantern to help minimize the digital production, hosting, and maintenance costs of multi-format textbook publishing by using open source software, free web services, and [static web technologies](https://lib-static.github.io/).

Lantern is a project by Chris Diaz (Digital Publishing Librarian) and Lauren McKeen McDonald (Open Education Librarian) of Northwestern University with support from the [Association of Research Libraries](https://www.arl.org/). Lantern is based on [Pandoc Book Template](https://github.com/wikiti/pandoc-book-template), and was inspired by numerous publishing tools, including [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), [Quire](https://quire.netlify.app/), [Course-in-a-Box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/), [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), and [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/).
